This file describes how to install KTIGCC.

A. Installing KTIGCC from RPMs
==============================

The recommended installation method for Fedora is to use the provided RPMs.
WARNING: This section is ONLY for Fedora Core 5 (and possibly later versions,
         though this is not guaranteed to work) users. If you're not running
         FC5 (or later), please skip to the next section.

1. Obtain the required prerequisites:
   1.1. The following RPMs from Fedora Core or Extras are required:
        glib2 (used by libti*)
        qt (NOT qt4)
        qt-devel (for the Qt Assistant help file viewer)
        kdelibs (obviously)
        desktop-file-utils (for update-desktop-database)
        These can be installed with:
        yum install glib2 qt qt-devel kdelibs desktop-file-utils
   1.2. The following RPMs packaged by me are required:
        tigcc - can be obtained from http://tigcc.ticalc.org/linux/
        libticables2 and libticonv - can be obtained from
          http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=23169
2. Install KTIGCC:
   rpm -Uvh tigcc*.i386.rpm libti*.i386.rpm ktigcc*.i386.rpm
   (RPMs are currently available only for the i386 architecture.)
3. KTIGCC should now show up in the menu. If it doesn't and you're running KDE,
   try:
   dcop kded kbuildsycoca "recreate()"
   It can also be found in /usr/local/tigcc/bin, which should be in your $PATH,
   so running ktigcc from an X11 terminal will also work.

B. Installing KTIGCC from source
================================

1. Obtain and install the required prerequisites:
   glib2 (*)
   Qt 3 (*) (NOT Qt 4)
   kdelibs from KDE 3 (*) (NOT KDE 4, which is not even alpha at the time I'm
                           writing this)
   Qt 3 Assistant (often included in qt or qt-devel packages)
   pkg-config
   libticables2 (*) and libticonv (*) - can be obtained from
     http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=23169
   TIGCC/*nix - can be obtained from http://tigcc.ticalc.org/linux/
   (*) If your distribution provides both a runtime and a -devel or -dev version
       of these packages, the -devel or -dev version is also needed.
   1.1. Installation instructions for libti*
        The libti* libraries are standard autotools projects, they should build
        and install just fine with:
        ./configure
        make
        make install
   1.2. Installation instructions for TIGCC/*nix
        Please refer to the INSTALL document coming with the TIGCC/*nix source
        tarball. The main stumbling blocks:
        * You have to fetch the GCC and GNU as sources separately and symlink
          the extracted versions to download/gcc.ti and download/binutils.ti
          respectively.
        * There is no configure script or makefile. Instead, do this:
          cd scripts
          ./Install
          and an interactive wizard will prompt you for everything else.
        This procedure is described in detail in the TIGCC/*nix INSTALL file.
2. qmake
   (You can run ./configure, but that just runs qmake.)
   WARNING: You need Qt 3 qmake.
3. make
4. make install
5. KTIGCC can now be found in your $TIGCC/bin directory.
