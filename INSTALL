This file describes how to install KTIGCC.

A. Installing KTIGCC from RPMs
==============================

The recommended installation method for Fedora is to use the provided RPMs.
WARNING: This section is ONLY for Fedora 7 (and possibly later versions, though
         this is not guaranteed to work) users. If you're not running Fedora 7
         (or later), please skip to the next section.

1. Obtain the required prerequisites:
   1.1. The following RPMs from Fedora are required:
        glib2 (used by libti*)
        qt4
        qt4-doc (for the Qt Assistant help file viewer)
        ctags (to locate C functions/prototypes)
        kdelibs4 (obviously) and kdebase4 (required for some features), as well
        as kdepimlibs and kdebase-runtime (required by kdebase4), version 4.0.0
        or higher
        These can be installed with:
        yum install kdebase4 qt4-doc ctags
   1.2. The following RPMs packaged by me are required:
        tigcc, ktigcc-completion-data, libticables2, libtifiles2, libticalcs2 and
        libticonv
        They can be obtained from:
        http://repo.calcforge.org/fedora/
2. Install KTIGCC:
   For i386 (32-bit x86) architectures:
   rpm -Uvh tigcc*.i386.rpm ktigcc-completion-data*.noarch.rpm libti*.i386.rpm ktigcc*.i386.rpm
   For x86_64 (64-bit AMD64/EM64T) architectures:
   rpm -Uvh tigcc*.x86_64.rpm ktigcc-completion-data*.noarch.rpm libti*.x86_64.rpm ktigcc*.x86_64.rpm
   (RPMs are currently available only for the i386 and x86_64 architectures.)
3. KTIGCC should now show up in the menu. If it doesn't and you're running KDE,
   try:
   dcop kded kbuildsycoca "recreate()"
   It can also be found in /usr/bin, which is in your $PATH, so running ktigcc
   from an X11 terminal will also work.

B. Installing KTIGCC from source
================================

1. Obtain and install the required prerequisites:
   glib2 (*)
   Qt 4 (*) (NOT Qt 3)
   kdelibs from KDE 4, version 4.0.0 or higher (*) (NOT KDE 3)
   kdebase from KDE 4 (should be the same version as kdelibs)
   Qt 4 Assistant (often included in qt4, qt4-doc or qt4-devel packages)
   pkg-config
   Exuberant Ctags - can be obtained from http://ctags.sourceforge.net
   libticables2 (*), libtifiles2 (*), libticalcs2 (*) and libticonv (*) - can be
     obtained from http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=23169
   TIGCC/*nix and TIGCCLIB completion data for KTIGCC (ktigcc-completion-data) -
     can be obtained from http://tigcc.ticalc.org/linux/
   (*) If your distribution provides both a runtime and a -devel or -dev version
       of these packages, the -devel or -dev version is also needed.
   1.1. Installation instructions for libti*
        The libti* libraries are standard autotools projects, they should build
        and install just fine with:
        ./configure
        make
        make install
   1.2. Installation instructions for TIGCC/*nix
        Please refer to the INSTALL document coming with the TIGCC/*nix source
        tarball. The main stumbling blocks:
        * You have to fetch the GCC and GNU as sources separately and symlink
          the extracted versions to download/gcc.ti and download/binutils.ti
          respectively.
        * There is no configure script or makefile. Instead, do this:
          cd scripts
          ./Install
          and an interactive wizard will prompt you for everything else.
        This procedure is described in detail in the TIGCC/*nix INSTALL file.
   1.3. Installation instructions for ktigcc-completion-data
        The tarball contains a file named "completion". This file should be
        extracted to `kde-config --expandvars --install data`/ktigcc/ (usually
        /usr/share/apps/ktigcc/).
2. qmake-qt4 (or qmake if that points to Qt 4 qmake)
   (You can run ./configure, but that just runs qmake-qt4.)
   WARNING: You need the Qt 4 version of qmake. Make sure you don't accidentally
            run the Qt 3 one.
3. make
4. make install
5. KTIGCC can now be found in your $TIGCC/bin directory.
