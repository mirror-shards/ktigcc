This file describes how to install KTIGCC.

A. Installing KTIGCC from RPMs
==============================

The recommended installation method for Fedora is to use the provided RPMs.
WARNING: This section is ONLY for Fedora 9 or later users. If you're not running
         Fedora 9 or later, please skip to the next section.

The easiest way to install the latest release of KTIGCC from RPMs is to install
calcforge-release from:
http://repo.calcforge.org/fedora/
Then it is enough to:
yum install ktigcc

Here's the step-by-step procedure to install the RPMs by hand (not recommended):
1. Obtain the required prerequisites:
   1.1. The following RPMs from Fedora are required:
        glib2 (used by libti*)
        qt3
        qt and qt-x11 (for the Qt Assistant help file viewer, the packages are
                       patched to use the Qt 4 version)
        kdelibs3, version 3.5.7 or higher
        kdebase3 (required for some features, should be the same version as
                  kdelibs3)
        ctags (to locate C functions/prototypes)
        These can be installed with:
        yum install glib2 qt-x11 kdebase3 ctags
   1.2. The following RPMs packaged by me are required:
        tigcc, ktigcc-completion-data, libticables2, libtifiles2, libticalcs2
        and libticonv
        They can be obtained from:
        http://repo.calcforge.org/fedora/
2. Install KTIGCC:
   For i386 (32-bit x86) architectures:
   rpm -Uvh tigcc*.i386.rpm ktigcc-completion-data*.noarch.rpm libti*.i386.rpm ktigcc*.i386.rpm
   For x86_64 (64-bit AMD64/EM64T) architectures:
   rpm -Uvh tigcc*.x86_64.rpm ktigcc-completion-data*.noarch.rpm libti*.x86_64.rpm ktigcc*.x86_64.rpm
   (RPMs are currently available only for the i386 and x86_64 architectures.)
3. KTIGCC should now show up in the menu.
   It can also be found in /usr/bin, which is in your $PATH, so running ktigcc
   from an X11 terminal will also work.
   If this is the first time you install TIGCC, you will have to restart your
   session (log out and log back in) to get the $TIGCC environment variable
   defined.

B. Installing KTIGCC from source
================================

1. Obtain and install the required prerequisites:
   glib2 (*)
   Qt 3 (*) (NOT Qt 4)
   kdelibs from KDE 3, version 3.5.7 or higher (*) (NOT KDE 4)
   kdebase from KDE 3 (should be the same version as kdelibs)
   Qt 3 Assistant (often included in qt or qt-devel packages)
   pkg-config
   Exuberant Ctags - can be obtained from http://ctags.sourceforge.net
   libticables2 (*), libtifiles2 (*), libticalcs2 (*) and libticonv (*) - can be
     obtained from http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=23169
   TIGCC/*nix and TIGCCLIB completion data for KTIGCC (ktigcc-completion-data) -
     can be obtained from http://tigcc.ticalc.org/linux/
   (*) If your distribution provides both a runtime and a -devel or -dev version
       of these packages, the -devel or -dev version is also needed.
   1.1. Installation instructions for libti*
        The libti* libraries are standard autotools projects, they should build
        and install just fine with:
        ./configure
        make
        make install
   1.2. Installation instructions for TIGCC/*nix
        Please refer to the INSTALL document coming with the TIGCC/*nix source
        tarball. The main stumbling blocks:
        * You have to fetch the GCC and GNU as sources separately and symlink
          the extracted versions to download/gcc.ti and download/binutils.ti
          respectively.
        * There is no configure script or makefile. Instead, do this:
          cd scripts
          ./Install
          and an interactive wizard will prompt you for everything else.
        This procedure is described in detail in the TIGCC/*nix INSTALL file.
   1.3. Installation instructions for ktigcc-completion-data
        The tarball contains a file named "completion". This file should be
        extracted to `kde-config --expandvars --install data`/ktigcc/ (usually
        /usr/share/apps/ktigcc/).
2. qmake
   (You can run ./configure, but that just runs qmake.)
   WARNING: You need Qt 3 qmake.
3. make
4. make install
5. KTIGCC can now be found in your $TIGCC/bin directory.
