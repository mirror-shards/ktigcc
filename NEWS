This is a summary of the changes in KTIGCC since the first alpha release:

CVS HEAD:

* Added NEWS file containing the history information previously published in the
  changelog snippets on SourceForge.
* Fixed moving files across file systems after compilation not working.


KTIGCC 20060814 beta:

Improvements:
* Kate's automatic indentation (ENTER indents the new line
  the same as the old one) is now enabled.
* The syntax highlighting descriptions are now
  automatically regenerated if they are missing or out of
  date.
* Tab now reliably inserts a tab. Use Ctrl+I to indent the
  selection (or the current line). (The other Kate defaults
  were also changed to match TIGCC IDE more closely.)
* Implemented coding template popups.
* Implemented "Find symbol declaration".
* Implemented Ctrl+Tab to switch between source files. As
  Ctrl+Tab is taken up by the default KDE shortcut
  settings, Ctrl+G can also be used.
* Implemented completion on Ctrl+Space. As Ctrl+Space
  conflicts with X input methods, Ctrl+M can also be used.
* Implemented prototype tooltips on opening a parenthesis.
* Because of conflicts (Ctrl+F9 is reserved by KDE for
  virtual desktop switching, Ctrl+Alt+F9 and
  Shift+Ctrl+Alt+F9 by X.Org X11 for virtual console
  switching), F8 can now be used instead of Ctrl+F9. So F8
  is Make and Alt+F8 is Compile. The Ctrl+F9 and
  Ctrl+Alt+F9 combos are also supported if they reach
  KTIGCC.
* Implemented the Shift+Ctrl+Alt+F9 (or Alt+Shift+F8, as
  per the above - note that you may have to press Alt first
  to get the combo recognized) combo (undocumented in TIGCC
  IDE) to switch transfer targets (TiEmu or real
  calculator) without going through the preferences.

Bugfixes:
* "New folder" wasn't always selecting the new folder for
  renaming. (Same for new files.)
* Fixed file descriptor leak in loadFileText.
* Opening the documentation could cause compilation and
  parsing (ctags) to lockup waiting for the external
  process (due to a conflict between Qt's and KDE's child
  process abstractions).

Notes:
* Debian (and derivate) users no longer need qt3-apps-dev
  to build KTIGCC.
* The KTIGCC RPM now requires ktigcc-completion-data, which
  contains completion information for TIGCCLIB. KTIGCC
  itself will run without it, but warn you (and suggest
  either downloading it or generating it yourself from the
  documentation source code).


KTIGCC 20060807 beta:

Improvements:
* Implemented customization of syntax highlighting.
* The default projects directory (i.e. the directory the
  file dialogs are set to on startup) is now
  ~/tigcc-projects (where ~ stands for your home directory)
  instead of $TIGCC/projects (which is not writable out of
  the box for regular users in system-wide TIGCC setups).
  It is created on startup if it's not there.
* The background color of list views and tree views is no
  longer hardcoded to white. (That was done to disable the
  alternating between 2 background colors, which is now
  disabled in a cleaner way.)

Bugfixes:
* KTIGCC now always adds a newline at the end of the
  temporary copies used for compiling, not just for C files
  (fixes warnings the Windows IDE filters out).
* "Discard" in a save prompt no longer resets the
  "modified" flag, so if you don't actually close the
  file/project being prompted for (for example because
  you're just opening an out-of-project file rather than a
  project), you'll be prompted for saving again later.
* "Save all" now saves out-of-project files only if they
  are actually modified (same as for in-project files).
* Ctrl+C/Ctrl+Ins now work as expected when the error
  window is shown: They apply to the error window if it has
  the focus, and the main window otherwise.
* KTIGCC now prompts for saving out-of-project source files
  before exiting.

Note: The "Find symbol declaration" menu entry has been
      hidden because it is not implemented yet.


KTIGCC 20060731 alpha:

* TIGCC/*nix 0.96 Beta 7 r1 is now required. This allows
  KTIGCC to link compressed programs with an external data
  file only once. (It used to link them twice to work
  around a now-fixed ld-tigcc limitation.)
* Implemented the following menu items:
  - Find / Open file at cursor
  - Help / News
  - the Tools menu
* Fixed 2 path handling bugs:
  - files already having an absolute path were mishandled
    when saving a new project for the first time
  - file names passed on the command line were not
    converted to absolute paths, causing problems


KTIGCC 20060723 alpha:

KTIGCC now requires the 20060723 snapshot of libti* and
TiEmu and makes use of its improvements. In particular:
* faster transfers to TiEmu: sending to TiEmu now longer
requires a harcoded 12-second wait. Instead, TiEmu now
reports by itself whether the emulated calculator is ready
or not. Thus, if TiEmu was already started, or if you have
a fast computer and "restrict to actual speed" unchecked,
the wait will be much less than 12 seconds.
* the source code for linking has been simplified by using
the new libticalcs2 APIs and dropping the compatibility
workaround for the new libticables2 ticables_is_usb_enabled
function.

I have also fixed the test for qassistantclient.h to work
on Debian and derivates.


KTIGCC 20060720 alpha:

* Implemented Find/Functions (both the dialog and the
toolbar dropdown).
* Exuberant Ctags (http://ctags.sourceforge.net) is now a
runtime requirement, used to locate C prototypes and
functions.
* Pushbuttons for standard actions (OK, Cancel, Close) now
show icons next to the text if KDE has been configured that
way.
* Fixed "use system icons" not to pad icons to 32x32.
* "Use system icons" is now the default, this can be
changed in the preferences.


KTIGCC 20060717 alpha:

Fixed bugs in compiling:
* The hack to fix ld-tigcc's output so "Program Variable
Name" is in the correct character set was always
adding "main\" because it checked for / instead of \ as the
path separator.
* External data file support for compressed programs was
completely broken.
* Opening a modal dialog during compilation could crash
KTIGCC.

Fixed Remove on a directory to prompt for saving for all
modified files in the directory. Pressing Del in the file
tree is now equivalent to Remove.

Implemented the Debug menu.

libtifiles2 and libticalcs2 are now required too.


KTIGCC 20060715 alpha:

KTIGCC can now compile projects (compile sources into object files and link them
into executables or static libraries, i.e. the Project menu is now complete).

KDElibs 3.5.2 or higher are now required.


KTIGCC 20060626 alpha:

KTIGCC can now open source files not belonging to a project in detached source
file windows.


KTIGCC 20060622 alpha:

This is the first snapshot of KTIGCC.
